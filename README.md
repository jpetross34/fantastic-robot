Code Louisville Project
I originally set out to make something akin to an author's page. Unfortunately, the more that I thought about it, the less I liked the idea. In the end, I made a page that some friends and I had been talking about for a while.
As for the requirements, I have included the following:
CSS
-the ":nth-child" occurs several times throughout the css.
-I managed to do some interesting things using Flexbox. (i.e., in the "about our creators" section i was able to make it into three rows with two columns when in the larger screen. I also managed to make the "Gaming" section into a row on larger screens, and into a column on a small screen)
I made the words "THE INDUBLY"---bounce.
JAVASCRIPT
-I created a hamburger menu for the top menu.
